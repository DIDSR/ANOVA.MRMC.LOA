This is an R package containing the codes and simulated results for the manuscript

Wen, S.& Gallas, B. D. (2021). Three-way Mixed Effect ANOVA to Estimate MRMC Limits of Agreement. arXiv preprint	[arXiv:2107.08891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08891). Submitted to Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research.
  
[SimulationStudies.RMD](https://github.com/SiWen314/ANOVA.MRMC.LOA/blob/main/inst/extra/SimulationStudies.Rmd) is an R markdown flile that shows how to replicate the results for the simulation studies in the manuscript. Here is the compiled version [SimulationStudies.pdf](https://github.com/SiWen314/ANOVA.MRMC.LOA/blob/main/inst/extra/SimulationStudies.pdf).

[iMRMC Rpackage](https://github.com/DIDSR/iMRMC/tree/master/Rpackage/iMRMC) contains the R functions for the Normal-Inverse-Gamma hiearachical simulation model and MRMC limits of agreement estimate by ANOVA.
